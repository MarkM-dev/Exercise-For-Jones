This project was build on a windows machine running node v10.6.0 & npm 6.1.0.

I've used one outside library called "Formik".

Instructions:
1. unzip the project.
2. cd into the project's directory.
3. run "npm install" to install all needed dependencies (since the "node_modules" folder is very heavy, iv'e cleared it's content. npm will automatically install all needed dependencies (including Formik library) using the package.json file.
4. run "npm start" to run the project server.
